Overview
Our project is a Dinosaur Application where we will be showcasing, you guessed it, dinosaurs! We hope to educate people a little bit more about these majestic creatures by providing trivias (and stats for nerds!).

This application was created for the Chingu Voyage 48. [Insert API here later]
