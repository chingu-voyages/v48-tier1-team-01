# Overview

Our project is a _Dinosaur Application_ where we will be showcasing, you guessed it, [dinosaurs](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera-gx&q=dinosaurs&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)!
We hope to educate people a little bit more about these majestic creatures by providing trivias (and stats for nerds!).

This application was created for the Chingu Voyage 48. [Insert API here later]
